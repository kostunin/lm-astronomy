In power density spectra of observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, we have found significant sidebands at the frequencies (n*f_0 - f_qpo) and (n*f_0 + f_qpo), where f_0 = 0.130 Hz is the pulsar spin frequency, f_qpo = 0.048 Hz is the QPO frequency, and n = 1,2,3... is an integer. These sidebands provide a diagnostic of the QPO mechanism.\n\nIn the 17-30 keV range the powers in the sidebands are symmetric about the harmonic frequencies. This suggests that the instantaneous amplitude of the coherent pulsations is modulated by the QPOs. This phenomenon is expected (for example) in models such as the magnetospheric beat frequency model (MBFM) where the QPOs originate near the polar caps of the neutron star, since any variation in the X-ray emission from the polar caps will affect the intensity of the coherent pulsations.\n\nIn the 4-8 keV range, however, the lower-frequency sidebands (at n*f_0 - f_qpo) are significantly stronger than their higher-frequency complements (at n*f_0 + f_qpo). Since simple amplitude modulation produces side bands with equal powers, there must be an additional oscillation at the frequencies (n*f_0 - f_qpo) that produces the excess power observed in the enhanced lower-frequency sidebands. In the MBFM there is nothing obvious that would explain the enhanced lower-frequency sidebands. Thus the observed sideband structure is inconsistent with the MBFM being the explanation for the 0.048 Hz QPOs.\n\nA scenario that explains the 0.048 Hz QPOs as well as the observed sideband structure is the following. Suppose a coherent structure (a \"blob\" of some kind) orbits the neutron star with an orbital frequency of 0.048 Hz, which may or may not be a Keplerian frequency (e.g., it may represent a wave packet traveling in the accretion disk). This blob modulates the optical depth along the line of sight as it orbits, producing the 0.048 Hz QPOs. When it crosses the line of sight between the Earth and the neutron star, it attenuates the pulsar beam; this modulates the coherent pulsations at 0.048 Hz and produces the symmetric sidebands. The blob orbits in the same direction as the neutron star rotation, so it reprocesses the pulsar beam at the beat frequencies between the pulsar harmonics and the QPOs (n*f_0 - f_qpo). Some of the reprocessed X-rays are returned along the line of sight, producing the enhanced lower-frequency side bands.\n\nQuite independently, we find no evidence that the red noise variability modulates the amplitude of the coherent pulsations. This is also in contrast to the expectations of the MBFM and differs from the behavior in some high-mass X-ray binary pulsars.\n\nMore information can be found in our manuscript (in preparation), available as a PostScript file at the URL associated with this telegram.\n\nPostScript for 1626 manuscript", "related_references": [], "fulltext_hyperlinked_references": [], "COLIBRI_NLP_NEL": [{"4U 1626-67": {"oid": 3399638, "canonical_name": "V* KZ TrA"}}, {"X-ray": {"oid": 3432331, "canonical_name": "* nu.

Lieu (Department of Physics, University of Alabama, Huntsville, AL 35899)", "publication_date": 884063460.0, "subjects": ["Optical", " Gamma Ray", " A Comment", " Gamma-Ray Burst"], "fulltext": "The recent detection of delayed Gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglows at longer wavelengths (van Paradijs et al 1997, Piro et al 1997, Bond 1997, Frail and Kulkarni 1997, Halpern et al 1997) supports strongly the notion that GRBs are produced at relativistic cosmological shocks (Pacynski 1986, Goodman 1986, Rees and Meszaros 1992). The current understanding is that these shocks are ultra-relativistic, with an upstream Lorentz factor Gamma ~300, and radiate the gamma rays as the shock accelerated electrons emit by the synchrotron or inverse-Compton process (Waxman 1997). \n\nA non-thermal origin of the GRB requires acceleration of electrons to energies comparable to those of the UHE cosmic rays. As already pointed out by Vietri (1995 and 1997), it is well known that diffusive acceleration at non-relativistic shocks is not rapid enough to produce such particles, which are at the top end of the cosmic ray spectrum (i.e. ~10^{20} eV). This same author also correctly noted that an earlier paper (Quenby and Lieu 1989) recognized for the first time an enhancement in the acceleration rate when a shock becomes relativistic. The effect, which may either be viewed in terms of a higher rate or a shorter time to reach a given particle energy when compared with conventional shocks, scales as Gamma^2, meaning that for Gamma ~300 acceleration can in principle be ~10^5 times faster. The production of gamma rays and UHE cosmic rays can therefore be achieved simultaneously at the sites of GRBs. \n\nThe original application of Quenby and Lieu (1989) was to termination shocks in AGN jets, and the value of Gamma assumed in that paper was ~3. Obviously since the Lorentz boosting scales as Gamma^2 the effect is far more important in GRBs. It is entirely reasonable to expect such a powerful mechanism to dominate other acceleration/energization process, and to easily overcome any complicating factors. For example, while our result was obtained assuming a parallel shock, the presence of a shock obliquity (i.e. a finite angle between the upstream flow vector and the upstream magnetic field) does not affect the basic physics (Lieu et al 1992). Even in the case of a perpendicular shock where the problem of returning particles upstream is most acute, the dense environment of the expanding GRB shells ensures sufficient turbulence to confine particles to within the shock vicinity by scattering. \n\nI conclude with a simple heuristic way of appreciating why relativistic shocks are such efficient accelerators by drawing an analogy with the inverse Compton process. The upstream cosmic ray particles are likened to the laboratory photons, while scatterers downstream of a relativistic shock are likened to the fast electrons. An elastic collision in the frame of a scatterer returns a quantum to the original (laboratory) frame with an energy gain of Gamma^2. This is especially so for relativistic shocks, where anisotropies in the particle distributions favor backward scattering events. Acceleration in this kind of environment are more appropriately classified as a  zeroth-order Fermi process. \n\nReferences \n\n  * Bond, H.E. 1997, IAUC # 6654 \n  * Frail, D.A. & Kulkarni, S.R. 1997, IAUC # 6662 \n  * Goodman, J. 1986, ApJ, 308, L47. \n  * Halpern, J. et al 1997, IAUC # 6788 \n  * Lieu, R., Quenby, J.J. & Naidu, K. 1992, ApJ, 421, 211. \n  * Quenby, J.J. & Lieu, R. 1989, Nature, 342, 654. \n  * Pacynski, B. 1986, ApJ, 308, L43. \n  * Piro, L. et al 1997, IAUC # 6656 \n  * Rees, M. & Meszaros, P. 1992, MNRAS, 258, 41P. \n  * van Paradijs, J. et al 1997, Nature, 386, 686. \n  * Vietri, M. 1995, ApJ, 453, 883. \n  * Vietri, M. 1997, PRL, 78, 4328. \n  * Waxman, E. 1997, ApJ, 489, L33.", "related_references": [], "fulltext_hyperlinked_references": ["http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06600/06654.html", "http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06600/06662.html", "http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06700/06788.html", "http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/06600/06656.html"], "COLIBRI_NLP_NEL": [], "COLIBRI_NLP_NER": {"Wavelength": ["Gamma", "gamma", "gamma"], "Person": ["Paradijs", "Meszaros", "Lieu", "Lieu", "Naidu,", "Paradijs,"], "Citation": ["et al 1997,", "Piro et al 1997,", "Bond 1997,", "Frail and Kulkarni 1997,", "Halpern et al 1997)", "1986,", "Goodman 1986,", "Rees and", "1992).", "1997).", "Vietri (1995", "1997),", "and", "1989)", "Quenby and", "et al 1992).", "Bond, H.E. 1997, IAUC # 6654", "Frail, D.A. & Kulkarni, S.R. 1997, IAUC # 6662", "Goodman, J. 1986, ApJ, 308,", "Halpern, J. et al 1997, IAUC # 6788", "Lieu, R.,", "Quenby, J.J.", "K. 1992, ApJ, 421,", "Quenby, J.J.", "Lieu, R. 1989, Nature, 342, 654.", "Pacynski, B. 1986, ApJ, 308,", "Piro, L. et al 1997, IAUC # 6656", "Rees, M. & Meszaros, P. 1992, MNRAS, 258, 41P.", "van", "J. et al 1997, Nature, 386,", "Vietri, M. 1995, ApJ, 453,", "Vietri, M. 1997, PRL, 78, 4328.", "Waxman, E. 1997, ApJ, 489, L33."], "Formula": ["Gamma^2,"]}}

Aycock using the LRIS instrument on Keck II. The observations were conducted between 1400--1600 UT of January 10, 1998 and images were obtained in the R band. The seeing was consistently 0.86 arcsec and 12 frames each of five minute duration were obtained. A source is clearly detected at the position of the OT. This source is fainter by 5.5 +/- 0.17 mag compared to object 2 of Henden et al. (GCN note [#016] of Dec 24, 1997). We measured pixel offsets between this source and object 2 and compared to similar offsets in the LRIS I-band image of Dec 15.47 1997 UT (see GCN note of Dec 17, 1997). The offsets match to better than 0.15 arcsec in each axis. \n\nA power law fit to the I-band data of Halpern et al.

The uncertainty represents maximum errors in the extrapolation. Diercks et al. (IAUC # 6791  ) note that the OT had R-I=1.0+/-0.4 on Dec 15.5 1997 UT. The subsequent two R band measurements (IAUC # 6791  ) appear to track the I-band points (to within errors). Thus, if there is no color evolution in the OT then the predicted R band magnitude on 10 January 1998 UT is between 27.2 and 28.0 mag with an offset uncertainty of 0.4 mag.

The seeing conditions were excellent. If the transient continued the power-law decay as indicated by the data from Halpern et al.

Kibble (Imperial College)", "publication_date": 889228200.0, "subjects": ["Gamma Ray", " Gamma-Ray Burst"], "fulltext": "It has long been recognized[1] that when a static electric field exceeds a critical value E_c corresponding to an electron acceleration of a_c ~2.4 x 10^31 cm per sec per sec, it is unstable with respect to pair production. The `vacuum breakdown' causes a E=E_c field to dissipate its energy in a timescale of ~10^-16 seconds, resulting in a mixture of gamma rays and pair plasma at temperature ~0.5 MeV. This paper outlines a theory of GRB based on the Schwinger mechanism (SM). \n\nThe first detection of optical afterglow[2] quickly led us to ascertain that GRB must be cosmological. Furthermore, the high redshift association[3,4] and the presence of deep and rapid modulations in the GRB flux[5] render it generally accepted that the intrinsic energy of a GRB is > 10^52 ergs and the size of the burst region (the `fireball', FB) is < 3 x 10^7 cm. \n\nThe data pose difficulties: even for gamma rays the Thomson optical depth of the FB is >> 1, implying radiation cannot escape unless the latter has expanded sufficiently. By then, however, the source size will be incompatible with observations. We emphasize that a relativistic bulk outflow is not an inevitable fate of the FB. If the FB contains 1 M_solar worth of baryonic matter (as we shall assume here) the gravitational potential would be sufficient to bind a system of matter and radiation at kT < 10 MeV within the FB radius. \n\nWe propose here an alternative model of GRB. We presume the energy injection at the FB is instantaneous. Since a quantum diffuses very slowly out of the FB, the energy density is simply total GRB energy : source volume. One then obtains U_GRB ~10^29 ergs per cc, or black body temperature of kT ~5 MeV. The dense FB ensures complete thermal equilibrium. This implies electrons and protons also have kT ~5 MeV, and system is bound. \n\nTo implement SM, one notes that the radiation pressure exerted by an expanding FB on the ambient matter (or an `envelope')  can cause a vacuum breakdown. The radiative electron acceleration is a = sigma_Th U_GRB/m_e ~7 x 10^31 cm s^-2 > a_c. Since proton acceleration is reduced by (m_e/m_p)^3, momentarily the electrons advance radially outwards. This means a field E > E_c must exist because the electrons move with a > a_c with respect to the protons. Such a field will discharge, and will convert the surface flow energy of the FB into thermal energy at kT < 0.5 MeV in an optically thin region just outside it. The discharge will propagate into the FB and `extract' the bulk of its energy into an avalanche of e+ e- pairs. The ensuing annihilation produces gamma rays which can escape to make a GRB. \n\nOn the observed GRB duration ~1 - 10 s. A static electric field of strength E ~ E_c must have length > an electron Compton wavelength ~2.5 x 10^-10 cm before it can discharge. Thus the FB radiation must push out the ambient plasma selectively to produce a discharge layer of thickness ~2.5 x 10^-10 cm, the SM will then dissipate field in 10^-16 sec. The ratio of these two nos implies the discharge propagates into the FB at speed 2.5 x 10^6 cm per sec. Given the FB size it will be consumed within the observed timescale. This slow, inward moving discharge layer provides ample time for the gamma rays and pairs already created outside it by the SM to escape from the optically thick FB (none of the created quanta is gravitationally bound). \n\nThe theory explains with simplicity the basic observed properties of a GRB, and may also be relevant to supernova explosions. \n\nReferences \n\n  * [1] Schwinger, J. 1951, Phys.

We have used public archival data of four observations of this source made with the PCA detectors of the RXTE during 1998, February 20 and 24. The QPO feature in the power density spectrum (PDS) is centered at 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 Hz and the rms variability at the QPO frequency is ~6.5%. Apart from the gaussian QPO feature, the PDS, in the frequency range of 0.006-0.6 Hz is power-law type with an index of -0.95. The energy spectrum in 2-60 keV range has been analyzed for one of the observations and it is found to be very hard and has the following components :  \na) black body component of temperature 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 keV,  \nb) iron fluroscence line at 6.60 \u00b1 0.07 keV of equivalent width 200 \u00b1 40ev,   \nc) power-law component with photon spectral index of 1.56 \u00b1 0.10 and  \nd) an ionized absorber.  \nTotal incident flux in the 1.3 - 100 keV observation band of the PCA detectors, is 9 \u00d7 10-10 erg cm-2 s-1. \n\nThis is the fifth X-ray pulsar after Cen X-3, EXO 2030+375, 4U 1626-67 and GRO J1744-28 in which QPOs have been detected. Assuming that the QPOs are produced as a result of some inhomogeneity at the magnetospheric boundary with the disk rotating at the Keplerian frequency (fK), the Keplerian frequency fK is derived to be 0.11 Hz . For a neutron star of mass 1.4 MSun, this indicates that the magnetosphere radius rM is 7.3 \u00d7 108 cm. From the X-ray luminosity of this pulsar for an assumed distance of rkpc, the magnetic field of this pulsar is estimated to be about ~1012 rkpc Gauss, where rkpc is the distance of the pulsar expressed in kiloparsec. \n\nThe Keplerian frequency of the disk at the magnetospheric radius is ~ 0.2 Hz in three of these five pulsars in which QPOs are observed. These are Cen X-3, EXO 23030+375 and 4U 1626-67. In the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28 the magnetic field strength is estimated to be much smaller which is consistent with a smaller magnetosphere with Keplerian frequency of the disk at magnetosphere being 40 Hz.

The probability that these two last GRBs events on July would occur by chance in that sky region , since SN1998bw event, is below 10^{-3}. The consequent probable repeater nature of GRB980425 in nearby host galaxy ESO184-G82 probes the Gamma Jet precessing nature either for GRBs (as well as their link to SGRs) contrary to any candle isotropic GRB model (either fireball/ hypernovae or magnetar). The relativistic kinematics for the Gamma Jets (do to Inverse Compton Scattering) imply that only the inner core of gamma jets contains hard and intense gamma photons while external regions of the beam are softer and weaker. Only nearest sources ( most intense ones ) may be (also) observed (as repeaters) in their wider beam periphery because of higher probability rate, due to wider cone cross section. Far away cosmic GRBs are observed rarely at their peak intensity near their SN birth and at their maximal power, while blazing to us within their inner and harder core beam . Jet power decay make far cosmic GRBs no longer (easely) observable as repeaters. The geometrical variability of such multi precessing gamma jet (arc minute size for corresponding Lorentz factor>10^{3}) explains the statistics, the energetics and the puzzling morphology of GRBs and SGRs data either at near and far Universe regions.

An extended object, which we believe to be the host galaxy of GRB970508, was detected at the astrometric position of the optical transient of GRB970508. The galaxy has high signal-to-noise in our data and is clearly resolved, with a major axis of approximately 0.\"5 . Including an uncertain contribution from the optical transient, the galaxy has a magnitude of V= 25.25 +/- 0.20, where the primary source of uncertainty is due to the wide bandpass (and thus poor color resolution) of the detector. This agrees reasonably well with previous photometric estimates (Bloom et al. 1998, Zharikov et al. 1998). \n\nThe image of the galaxy is well described by an exponential disk with a scale length of approximately 0.\"07, and an ellipticity of 0.3. However, the FWHM of the PSF is comparable in size to the observed scale length; thus an accurate measurement of the surface brightness profile of the galaxy will require modelling and/or deconvolution. \n\nWe have obtained an astrometric solution with an r.m.s. uncertainty of approximatgely 0.\"01 which maps the previous STIS image (Fruchter et al. 1997, Pian et al 1998) onto the new data.
